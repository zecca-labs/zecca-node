### What is Zecca?

Zecca is a digital asset transfer protocol that protects user privacy and enables compliance with AML/KYC rules.  Zecca solves several core problems with public blockchains:  it's fast, scalable, environmentally friendly, privacy focused, natively integrates with digital identity, facilitates regulatory compliance, and permits both permissioned and permissionless transfers of assets.  

Zecca creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and uses an Open Representative Voting (ORV) consensus mechanism. It operates a block-lattice data structure.
